# px-api-prophet
## Running Facebook Prophet model for forecasting Statistics Norway data via Statbank API
This the result of an internal hackathon at Statistics Norway september 2018. 

Inspired by [`Eurostat/Prophet`](https://github.com/eurostat/prophet) and [`stats_to_pandas`](https://github.com/hmelberg/stats-to-pandas). Result of internal hackathon at SSB.
It combines a rework of stats_to_pandas with Facebook's forecasting model Prophet.

The Jupyter notebook needs the enclosed file APIdata.py. See the notebook for more information.
